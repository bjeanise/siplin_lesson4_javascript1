### Project Description:
Lesson 4 introduced fundamentals and best practice concepts in JavaScript
programming via course notes, the Expense Calculator Application, and Try-It 
exercises. Noted in the section _Lessons Learned in the Assignment_ herein this
**READMe.md** document are three concepts from among those presented on and 
illustrated in the Lesson 4 materials, assignment, and exercises.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1.  In the course materials, I was apprised of best practices in JavaScript 
    programming that included choosing short but readable variable names; 
    avoiding global variables; and using comments in programming code. The 
    *Try-It* exercises and *Expense Calculator Application* further 
    supplemented my learning. For example, the JavaScript portion in the 
    *Expense Calculator Application* assignment reflected use of  **var** when 
    initializing variables, variable names were readable and not too lengthy, 
    and comments in the programming code guided my completion of the  *Try-It* 
    exercises and the *Expense Calculator Application* assignment.

2.  As a best practice, comments in JavaScript programming are 
    to be appropriate, useful, and not too numerous. The *Expense Calculator Application* 
    enhanced my awareness of the importance of using commenting when writing 
    code. Moreover, as a web developer,  it is important that I appropriately include 
    comments in my coding for personal guidance purposes when updating web 
    development projects I completed earlier--and for providing insight to those who work, in my absence, on web development projects that I created.

3.  Practice is very important for learning how to program in JavaScript. By way of *Try-It* exercises, I was guided in writing code that illustrated the following review types and operators: 

    * JavaScript data types strings, 
    numbers, Booleans, and null; 
    *  Data printed or logged to the console using
    console.log(); 
    *  Built-in mathematical operators
       _+, -, *, and /_; 
    *  JavaScript associating certain properties with different data types; and 
    *  JavaScript built-in methods for different data types.
